## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0]
* New: `LoadingOverlay.withFuture` constructor to display the overlay until a
	provided `Future` completes.
	- Starts visible immediately and hides automatically on completion (success
		or error) using the existing fade-out animation.
	- Works alongside the existing boolean `isLoading` constructor â€” no breaking
		changes to the public API.
	- If the `future` instance changes during rebuilds, the overlay will show
		again and re-wire to the new `Future`'s completion.
* Documentation: README updated with usage examples for both boolean and
	future-driven patterns.
* Tests: Added widget tests covering the new `withFuture` behavior.
